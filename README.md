## What's this?
This project showcases how `@webiny/app-page-builder` can be integrated into any React app. It still communicates with Webiny API, so you must have a working Webiny project to use its API. 

> For questions on how to push it even further join Webiny Gitter at https://gitter.im/Webiny/webiny-js.
We'll be glad to help and hear about your project.

## Before you begin...
1) Setup a Webiny project: https://docs.webiny.com/docs/get-started/quick-start
2) Open `package.json` and set your `REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_API_URL` to point to your Webiny API. Ideally you should set these via an `.env` file; this is just an example so do whatever you want with it.

## Other
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
